\subsubsection{The Physical Setup (The Brewery Machine)}

\subsubsection{The Simulator}
The group is going to use the simulator software to test the software during the
development cycle.
It is important to note that the simulator is not a replacement of the machine
since there is only so much randomness and correctness you can get from a 
simulator. 
It is still very important to have the simulator, when making prototypes and 
performing multiple tests on it, so any regressions won't be pushed to 
the production system(the beer machine).
