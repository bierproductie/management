\section{Requirements}

\subsection{Overall Requirements Specification}
\subsubsection{Summary of requirements}
The group's proposed solution will adhere to the requirements given by the
brewery Refslevbæk Bryghus A/S, which can be seen in the project description.

The manufacturing execution system, MES, must be able to control the brewery’s production.
It must be able to start and stop the production line,
as well as monitor the production and collect data from the production line.
The data must be stored for further analysis.
The MES must be able to keep track of the batches that the new machine is producing,
as well as collect various data from the machine that is associated with the current batch number.
After a finished batch production, the MES must be able to produce a batch report.
The report must contain the following.

\begin{itemize}
    \item This Batch ID
    \item Product type
    \item Amount of products (total, defect and acceptable)
    \item Amount of time used in the different states
    \item Logging of temperature over the production time
    \item Logging of humidity over the production time
\end{itemize}

The MES must be able to monitor the production and display live relevant data
from the machine. The documentation of the system must contain an illustration
that defines the different components in the setup, in relation to the
ISA88\^{}1213 Part 1 Physical Hierarchy model. The system must have a
visualisation that can be accessed and used to display production data. The
system must be able to collect the necessary data from the machine and calculate
the overall equipment effectiveness, OEE\^{}131516, of the machine. The OEE must
be available to be displayed by the system. The system must be able to estimate
the error function associated with the different products. The system must be
able to find the optimal production speed for each product type, based on an
error simulation and the appertaining graph upon which the error simulation is
built.

\subsubsection{List of requirements}
Below, in Table \ref{table:Requirements}, is a list of the above requirements. These requirements have been
prioritised using the MoSCoW method, where M is for Must have, S is for
Should have, C is for could have, and W is for Won't have.

\subsection{Use Cases}
Use cases are written descriptions of how a user will perform different tasks
on a system. They outline a systems behaviour as it responds to a request from
the user. Each use case is represented as a sequence of steps, beginning with
the users goal and ending it when that goal is fulfilled. \\

The first step in developing use cases is to determine the actors.


% \begin{table}[ht]
%    \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|>{\RaggedRight}p{3cm}|>{\RaggedRight}X|>{\RaggedRight}p{2.5cm}|}
%     \hline
%     \textbf{Use Case ID}   & \textbf{Name}                                 & \textbf{Definition}\\ \hline
%     UC01                   & Start production line                         & User \\ \hline
%     UC02                   & Stop production line                          & User \\ \hline
%     UC03                   & Monitor and store data from production line   & SCADA \\ \hline
%     UC04                   & Monitor and display relevant data live        & SCADA \\ \hline
%     UC05                   & Create batch report                           & MES \\ \hline

%     UC08                   & Find optimal production speed                 & MES \\ \hline
%     \end{tabularx}
%     \caption{Use Cases}
%     \label{table:use_cases}
%     \end{table}

\subsubsection{Actor List}
In order to determine who will be able to access the system, the actors are
found. An actor is defined as any external system or user that communicates
with the system. Not every actor can necessarily be found at the given time,
meaning other actors may be found later during development.

The identified actors can be seen in Table \ref{table:actor_list}. With these
actors, a visualisation can be made, depicting how the different actors
communicate with the system.

\begin{table}[H]
    \captionof{table}{Actor list}
     \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|>{\RaggedRight}p{2.5cm}|>{\RaggedRight}p{8cm}|>{\RaggedRight}X|}
     \hline
     \textbf{Actor} 				& \textbf{Description}                                                                                                              				& \textbf{Goal} \\ \hline
     \multirow{2}{*}{User (p)}      & The user represents the worker of the machine. The user will use the control panel to control the machine.                                  		& 	\begin{itemize}
     																																														\item Control machine
     																																														\item Start new batches
     																																													\end{itemize} \\ \hline
     \multirow{2}{*}{BPM (s)}     	& The beer production machine is responsible for supplying data to the MES and producing the beer.       											& \begin{itemize} 
     																																														\item Collect and save data
     																																														\item Communicate between hardware and MES 
     																																									 				\end{itemize} \\ \hline
    \end{tabularx}
    \label{table:actor_list}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Detailed Use Cases}
When the actors have been determined, use cases can be developed. These use
cases add value because they help explain how the system behaves and which
functions to include when developing the system. As seen below, in Table
\ref{table:usecase_start}, which represents the sequence of steps happening
when a user wants to start the beer production machine. This use case clarifies
the functions needed to fulfil the users goal, to start the production machine.
The remaining detailed use cases can be seen in appendix \ref{app:usecases}.

        \textbf{ID:} UC01  \\
        \hline
        \textbf{Primary actor:} The user \\
        \hline
        \textbf{Secondary actor:} Beer production machine \\
        \hline
        \textbf{Short description:} The MES must be able to start the brewery's
        production \\
        \hline
        \textbf{Pre conditions:} The beer production machine needs to be in
        ready mode, that is, not producing beer. \\
        \hline
        \textbf{Main flow:} \\
        	1. This use case starts when a user wants to start the beer
        	production machine. \\
        	2. The user chooses what kind of beer to be produced. \\
        	3. The user sets production speed. \\
        	4. The user sets batch id. \\
        	5. The user sets amount of beers to be produced. \\
        	6. The user presses the start button. \\
        	7. The MES starts the machine. \\
        	8. When the production has finished, the MES stores data from the
        	production. \\

		\hline
        \textbf{post conditions:} The beer production machine is turned on \\
        \hline
        \textbf{Alternative flow:} \\
        	Step 8: If the machine does not complete the production (for various
        	reasons) the production stops and stores the data from the machine
        	and the user receives an error message. \\
