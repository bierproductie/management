\subsubsection{The Physical Setup (The Brewery Machine)}

\subsubsection{The Simulator}
The group are going to use the simulator software to test the software in the
development cycle.
The simulator is not a replacement of the machine since there is only
so much randomness and correctness you can get out of a simulator, but it is 
still very important to have the simulator, for making prototypes and make 
multiple tests for it, so the group don't push any regressions to the production
system(the beer machine).
