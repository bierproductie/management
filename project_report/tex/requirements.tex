\subsubsection{The Simulator}
The group are going to use the simulator software to test their software in the 
Development cycle. 
The group need the simulation software to quickly make prototypes and see if it
works probably and have no regressions since the last version before they pushed
it to the production machine.
The simulator is never going to beat the real thing because there is only
so much randomness and correctness you can get of a simulator, but it is still
very important to have the simulator, for making prototypes and make multiple
tests for it, so they don't make any regressions in the production system. 
The production system Is the beer machine.
