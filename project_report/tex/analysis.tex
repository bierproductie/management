\subsection{Use Case analysis}

\subsubsection{Class Candidates}
In order to find potential class candidates, every noun of the detailed Use Cases are found.
These are potential candidates, and can be sorted to avoid duplicates and candidates that 
wonâ€™t be turned into classes. Naturally, every potential class for the entire system will 
not be found, as this only reflects use cases. A potential class candidate such as MES 
(where Start and Stop functionality would otherwise be implemented) will not be reduced to 
a single class and is therefore not added to the list of class candidates.

The final list of classes, as well as a description of them, can be seen in table (x).

    Batch                    & Id, type, product\_amount (total, defect, acceptable), amount (time), state (current, history), OEE, production\_speed, & A batch refers to a specific batch of products the brewery has made                    \\ \hline
    Product                  & Id, type, Ingredients,                                                                                                  & Product refers to the different options of beer to be produced                         \\ \hline
