The updated UML class diagram illustrates the current system idea based on the 
analysis of the system. Although this diagram only shows the 
OPC-UA client, it still gives a good idea of how this part of the system is going
to be, once implemented. \\

By using the diagram in implementation, the process gets a good starting point 
to expand on. The classes in the UML class diagram have a chance of not being 
implemented if the group finds them unuseful or changed to adhere to the program
.
