\section{Background}
The brewery Refslevbæk Bryghus A/S recently won the “best beer of the year” 
award, which has led to a boost in demand for their products. Before this boost,
every product was made in smaller batches, however, their current production
line does not fulfil these demands. This has led them to purchase a new, bigger
brewing machine. So far, the brewing has involved a lot of manual processes.
The brewery now needs a new brewing system developed, that implements a large
degree of automation, and enables it to produce beer most efficiently.
