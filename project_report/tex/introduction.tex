\section{Introduction}

% Motivation from project proposal
As students, this semester project gives the group great learning experience as
well as a good idea of how such a project would progress. During the project,
the group will learn how to create and set up an Open Platform Communications
Unified Architecture, OPC-UA, client, and how to make it communicate directly
to a physical machine. The group will learn to host a web server, from which the
machine can be controlled, and access it as a website. The group will also have
the chance to learn and use a new scripting language, JavaScript. The gained
experience is the primary motivation of this project.

% Overview of project
\subsection{Overview of project}
This project aims to improve the beer machine by increasing quantity while 
maintaining quality. To accomplish this the project will offer an interactive 
web interface for monitoring, controlling and adjusting the brewery machine. 
This is done by having the web interface interact with a REST API that connects 
to a client. This client controls the machine through an OPC-UA server 
connection and stores relevant data in a database.

% Objectives
\subsection{Objectives}
The group wants to create a dashboard solution, that gets the necessary
information from the brewery machine to display information about the current
- and previous batches.

The group wants to host the REST API and Website on a Linux based server on a
fully qualified domain name using the container technology Docker which should
be configured via Docker Compose. Furthermore, the group aims to set up a
continuous integration pipeline for development via GitHub Actions (makes it
easy to automate software workflows) and continuous delivery via Watchtower (an
automatic deployment tool).

The distributed system consists of five sub-systems, where the group are writing three
of them.

\subsubsection{OPC-UA Client}
The OPC-UA client is responsible for communicating with the brewing machine via
the OPC-UA server. This is needed to send and receive data via
commands.

\subsubsection{Website}
The website user interface is where the client will be able to interact with
our system. The website will enable the user to control, monitor and adjust
the brewing machine. Live relevant data will also be collected, displayed and
can be downloaded as a report.

% The subsubsection 3.2: Website is not very detailed. It would be nice to know how 
% a user wouldinteract with the system. What kind of “functionality” will the 
% remote interface contain?

\subsubsection{REST API}
The REST API functions primarily as a gateway in this design. For the
front-end to receive data via fetch calls in JavaScript, it needs to communicate 
with something that uses HTTP and preferably delivers data in JSON.
