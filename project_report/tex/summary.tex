\section{Summary}
The purpose of this project has been to develop an MES for the brewery
Refslevbæk Bryghus A/S, in order to optimize the production line, so the brewery
can keep up with the demand. The brewery recently bought a new brewing machine,
and a simulator of this has been made available to the group. An initial
requirements analysis of the project case has been made, and based on this, the
group has narrowed the problem down to the following:\\

\textit{"How to apply an MES to control and optimise the brewing process at
Refslevbæk Bryghus A/S, to maximise the production of high-quiality beer."}\\

During the development, the group has made use of the framework Scrum, to
organise the group work. Every week, a meeting has been held to plan ahead in
the development process as well as make issues for the planned tasks. These
issues are assigned to a two week sprint. To manage this, the management
solution, ZenHub, has been used alongside GitHub. For each task, an issue has
been created and a group member has been assigned. \\

The group has managed to develop an MES consisting of a frontend
website, an API and an OPC Client. The website acts as a control panel, from
which a beer batch can be started. The website displays relevant data in real
time, which can be interacted with. From the frontend, a history page with 
information, regarding past batches, can be accessed. The data is used for batch
reports and further analysis, and is stored in a database. The stored data is
used to further optimise the production line, for example by calculating the
Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE). The REST API is used as a translater
between the different subsystems in the MES.
