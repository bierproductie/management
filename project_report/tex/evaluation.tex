\section{Evaluation}
The evaluation section describes how the reflections of the goals, set for the
project, meets the customer demands, as well as how the development process has
been.


\subsection{Evaluation from the customer side}
The group has managed to meet the requirements, set in the initial requirements
analysis, in the beginning of the project. The created system is able to control
the production line, using the dashboard, and is able to collect, display and
store relevant data in a database. The data is used for further analysis, such
as calculating the OEE and optimal machine speed, as well as estimating the
error function.


\subsection{Development process}
In the beginning of the development process, the group has held as meeting
about how the projects should be structured. Building on the experience from
last semester where Unified Process and Scrum was used, the group has
decided to use both UP and Scrum again. Every Friday, a Scrum meeting is held,
to show and discuss what each group member has accomplished. Each task is
assigned into a two week sprint, which is planned at the appropriate Scrum
meeting.
During 'matching of expectations', the group agreed upon focusing on the Minimum
Viable Product, meaning not implementing parts outside of the semester project's
scope.
