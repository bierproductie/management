\subsection{Development process}
The development processes started, with the group holding a meeting about
how the group should structure the project.
The group started out with experience from last semester about UP and scrum.
It have worked well last semester and would try the same thing again, just a tad
bit earlier this time, than we would be in half the semester before we used scrum
as we did it in the last semester.
Scrum meeting was every Friday. Every other Friday we figured out what to do the next 
14 days and If we would have do it again the next coming Friday, that depends on
what the planning was.

The group started to figure out what how much effort they would put in this project,
because last semester the group got a little burned out of doing a little to much.
The group chose to to the MVP(Minimum Viable Product), but they still accidentally
made a little more and it did bit the group a little in the but, because the group 
could not implement the rest of the system before the first part is in it place.

    It could be a discussion of what process you used to structure your development work and how it worked,
    an analysis of how well you answered the requirements you outlined earlier, 
    as well as an overall conclusion.
