\section{Evaluation}
The evaluation section describes how the reflections of the goals, set for the
project, meet the customer demands, as well as how the development process has
been.


\subsection{Evaluation from a customer point of view}
The group has managed to meet the requirements, set in the initial requirements
analysis at the beginning of the project. The created system is able to control
the production line, using the dashboard, as well as collect, display, and
store relevant data in a database. The data is used for further analysis, such
as calculating the OEE and optimal machine speed, as well as estimating the
error function. All the needed functions are available from the front page,
except starting the beer machine. The start button redirects the user to a
start-batch page where a recipe, speed, and the amount to produce can be chosen.
The start-batch page is not that convenient, because the page does not put in
the recommended values for the different recipes, but it does show the
recommended values for the recipe. In order to see past batches, the history
page should be navigated to. This page is easily accessible from the front page
by pressing on the button on to menu bar placed to the left. Here, past batches
can be selected and further inspected. The button layout is the same as the
front page, so there should be no learning curve when inspecting the previous
batches.


\subsection{Development process}
At the beginning of the development process, the group has held a meeting
about how the projects should be structured. Building on the experience from
last semester where Unified Process and Scrum were used, the group decided to
use both UP and Scrum again. Every Friday, a Scrum meeting was held, to show and
discuss what each group member has accomplished. Each task was assigned to a
two-week sprint, which was planned at the appropriate Scrum meeting. During
'matching of expectations', the group agreed upon focusing on the Minimum
Viable Product, meaning not implementing parts outside of the semester project's
scope. The use of Scrum has given a great overview of the project and has made
it easier to plan ahead. However, looking back, the group should have scheduled 
more in the beginning. Near the end, the group has had long work hours.\\

The project has been divided into the four phases of Unified Process; Inception,
Elaboration, Construction, and Transition. Each phase has been a fixed boundary
to plan around, making it easier to schedule sprints, tasks, and issues. The
group could have worked more efficiently in the initial phases of the Unified
Process, enabling the group to begin the Construction phase sooner.
