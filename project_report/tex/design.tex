\subsection{Dashboard}
The dashboard for the beer production system, is designed with
the proposed visualisation in mind. From the dashboard the user can easily
control the machine using the control panel in the bottom right. Here the
duration the machine has been running can also be seen. The red bar with a
wrench icon indicates how close the machine is to needing service. The dashboard
gives a quick and easy overview of inventory status, as well as relevant data
from the batch that is currently being brewed. For more detailed information
regarding relevant data, each section containing data functions as a button,
which displays a graph of logged data when pressed. At the top right of the
screen, the batch ID can be seen, identifying which batch the data displayed,
is from. This is also a drop down menu, enabling the user to change what batch,
the displayed information is from.

When starting a batch, the user will be able to choose what type of product the
machine should brew.
