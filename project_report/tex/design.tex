\subsection{Dashboard design}
The dashboard for the beer production system, is designed with
the proposed visualisation in mind. This visualisation requires inventory
status, mintenance status bar, display of relevant data from the machine and
a control panel to start, stop, reset, abort and clear the machine. On top of
that, the group wants a way to display logging of the data during the brewing
of a batch. This can be in the form of a graph. The user should also have a
way to change what batch, the displayed information is from.

The group settled on the design seen in figure (x). From the dashboard the user
can easily control the machine using the control panel in the bottom right.
Here the duration the machine has been running can also be seen. The red bar
with a wrench icon indicates how close the machine is to needing service. The
dashboard gives a quick and easy overview of inventory status, as well as
relevant data from the batch that is currently being brewed. For more detailed
information regarding relevant data, each section containing data functions as
a button, which displays a graph of logged data when pressed. At the top right
of the screen, the batch ID can be seen, identifying which batch the data
displayed, is from. This is also a drop down menu, enabling the user to change
what batch, the displayed information is from.

When starting a batch, the user will be able to choose what type of product the
machine should brew.
