\subsection{Verification}
\subsubsection{control production} 
The system allows control of the production line. The production line can be 
started, stopped, cleared, reset and aborted through the dashboard. This fulfils 
requirements R01-R02 in the list of requirements.

\subsubsection{Data processing}
The system monitors batch data from the production line. The batch data is 
stored in the database and kept track by using the batch id. This allows the 
data to be accessed in the history page of the dashboard after it has run. Thus 
fulfilling requirements R03-R06.

\subsubsection{Data presentation}
Having access to past batches and their data allows the dashboard to provide a 
visualization of batch reports and live data. Fulfilling requirement R07, R08 
and R10.

\subsubsection{Optimization}
Based on past and present data, the system can be optimized. The system is 
optimized by calculating Overall Equipment Effenciy(OEE), estimating error 
function and optimal production speed. These features fulfil requirements 
R11-R13 completing the list of requirements.

This verifies, that the system fulfils all the requirements which were 
prioritised in the Overall Requirements Specification.

\subsection{Validation}
How well did we handle the implementation of the requirements.*
