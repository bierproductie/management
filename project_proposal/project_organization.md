### Project Organisation

In this project, work is distributed from planning meetings. These planning
meetings take place at the beginning of each sprint, where the workload is
estimated and distributed across the team members. Kjako19 was chosen to be the
Product Owner, so he oversees the “what”, with a focus on value, time to market
etc. Kechr19 was chosen to be Scrum Master, so he must ensure that the Scrum
framework is understood and is used correctly throughout this project. Like the
rest of the group, they are also a part of the Development Team.
