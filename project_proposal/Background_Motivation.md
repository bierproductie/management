# Background and motivation

## Background
The brewery Refslevbæk Bryghus A/S recently won the “best beer of the year” award, which has led to a boost in demand of their products. However, their current production line does not fulfil these demands, and so they have purchased a new, bigger brewing machine. So far, the brewing has involved a lot of manual processes. The brewery now needs a new brewing system developed, that implements a large degree of automation, and enables it to produce beer in the most efficient way.

## Motivation
As students, this semester project gives the group a great learning experience. During the project, the group will learn how to create and setup a OPC-UA client, and how to make it communicate directly to a physical machine. The group will learn to host a webserver, from which the machine can be controlled, and access it as a website.
The need for an automated system, as well as the learning experience is the main motivation of this project.
