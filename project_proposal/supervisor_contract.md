of the other semester subjects.
- The supervisor meeting is scheduled for each Friday, however the time of each
meeting can vary and is therefore agreed upon on the previous meeting.
- The supervisor is responsible for bringing up deadline uncertainties to
maximize the possibility of a successful project.

supervisor, it will be discussed on the weekly meeting.
