### Stakeholders

For this project we don't have any external stakeholders, which is a problem.
When developing using SCRUM, there's a Product Owner role (abbreviated to PO
from here on out). The PO should under normal circumstances be one from the
customer's firm, and their job is to choose which features (user stories) that
they would like developed next. Since such a person doesn't exist for this
project, we have instead pinpointed Kjako19 within our group to fulfill this
role.
