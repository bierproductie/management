### Stakeholders

For this project the group does not have any external stakeholders, which is a
problem when developing using SCRUM, since this role is usually filled by a
Product Owner role (abbreviated to PO from here on out). The PO should under
normal circumstances be one from the customers firm, and their job is to choose
which features (user stories) that they would like developed next. Since such a
person does not exist for this project, the group have instead pinpointed
Kjako19 to fulfill this role.
