### Stakeholders

For this project we do not have any external stakeholders, which is a problem.
When developing using SCRUM, there is a Product Owner role (abbreviated to PO
from here on out). The PO should under normal circumstances be one from the
customers firm, and their job is to choose which features (user stories) that
they would like developed next. Since such a person does not exist for this
project, we have instead pinpointed Kjako19 within our group to fulfill this
role.
