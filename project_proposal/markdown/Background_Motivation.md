# Motivation

As students, this semester project gives the group a great learning experience as well as a good idea of how such a project would progress. During the project, the group will learn how to create and setup a OPC-UA client, and how to make it communicate directly to a physical machine. The group will learn to host a webserver, from which the machine can be controlled, and access it as a website. The group will also have the chance to learn and use a new scripting language, JavaScript.
The gained experience is the main motivation of this project.
