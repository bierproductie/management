*Project Plan*
To keep track of the _overall time schedule (fucking offshore jysk)_, a project
plan has been made with inspiration from the
[project plan supplied by the supervisor.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mZXxgDiwWwWpSyaQmMcafTjvXa2lQriszwTyt-Pf5BA/edit#gid=0)

In this it is shown when the different milestones must be completed to succeed
with the project. As mentioned above, sprints with a duration of two weeks will
be used throughout this project. Each sprint consists of issues from the product
backlog and is chosen at the beginning of each sprint, as de-scribed in section
Methods. To keep track of these sprints, a burn down chart will be made, as seen
below.

This ensures the group that each sprint is successfully completed, and if not,
it is easy to see where it went wrong, and the remaining issues can be
transferred to the next sprint.
