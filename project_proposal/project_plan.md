*Project Plan*
To keep track of the _overall time schedule (fucking offshore jysk)_, a project plan has been made with in-spiration from the [project plan supplied by the supervisor.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mZXxgDiwWwWpSyaQmMcafTjvXa2lQriszwTyt-Pf5BA/edit#gid=0)

In this it is shown when the different milestones must be completed to succeed with the project.
As mentioned above, sprints with a duration of two weeks will be used throughout this project. Each sprint consists of issues from the product backlog and is chosen at the beginning of each sprint, as de-scribed in section Methods. To keep track of these sprints, a burndown chart will be made, as seen be-low.

This ensures the group that each sprint is successfully completed, and if not, it is easy to see where it went wrong, and the remaining issues can be transferred to the next sprint.
