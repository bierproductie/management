*Methods*
To keep track of the groupwork the Scrum framework, with a few buts, is used. Scrum consist of multiple artifacts and ceremonies, and in this project product roadmap, Scrum meetings, product and sprint back-logs and burndown charts will be used. Each sprint will have a duration of two weeks and the issues for the sprint backlog will be chosen at the beginning of each sprint, at the Scrum meeting. The Scrum meet-ing will take place each Friday and will be a mixture of sprint planning, daily Scrum, and sprint review.
To manage Scrum, ZenHub, a management solution that can be integrated with GitHub, is used. On ZenHub the group will create the roadmap, that acts as a time schedule for the project and board, which is where the issues will be handled. A burndown chart for each sprint is automatically generated and kept up to date by ZenHub. The board will consist of five columns, as seen below.

Product Baklog: Issues
Sprint Backlog: Issues for the given sprint
In Progress: Issues that is currently being worked on
Review/QA: Issues that have been completed, but not yet approved by other group members
Closed: Approved issues that have been merged to master
