\section{Background}
The brewery Refslevbæk Bryghus A/S recently won the “best beer of the year” 
award, which has led to a boost in demand for their products. However, their 
current production line does not fulfil these demands, and so they have 
purchased a new, bigger brewing machine. So far, the brewing has involved a lot 
of manual processes. The brewery now needs a new brewing system developed, that 
implements a large degree of automation, and enables it to produce beer most
efficiently.

\section{Motivation}
As students, this semester project gives the group great learning experience as
well as a good idea of how such a project would progress. During the project,
the group will learn how to create and set up an Open Platform Communications
Unified Architecture, OPC-UA, client, and how to make it communicate directly
to a physical machine. The group will learn to host a web server, from which the
machine can be controlled, and access it as a website. The group will also have
the chance to learn and use a new scripting language, JavaScript. The gained
experience is the main motivation of this project.

\section{Aim}
This project aims to improve the beer machine by increasing quantity while 
maintaining quality. To accomplish this the project will offer an interactive 
web interface for monitoring, controlling and adjusting the brewery machine. 
This is done by having the web interface interact with a REST API that connects 
to a client. This client controls the machine through an OPC-UA server 
connection and stores relevant data in a database.

% group 7: The section “Aim”could be specified with more details.
% France: I think the ultimate goal is to improve the beer machine: increase the 
% quantity while maintaining the quality? thats why you are doing these automation and remote control


\section{Solutions}
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering 
\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{images/system_drawing.pdf}
\label{figure:System_drawing}
\caption{System drawing} 
\end{figure}

The distributed system consists of five sub-systems, where the group are writing three
of them.

\subsection{OPC-UA Client}
The OPC-UA client is responsible for communicating with the brewing machine via
the OPC-UA server. This is needed to send and receive data via
commands.

\subsection{Website}
The website user interface is where the client will be able to interact with
our system. The website will enable the user to control, monitor and adjust
the brewing machine. Live relevant data will also be collected, displayed and
can be downloaded as a report.

% The subsection 3.2: Website is not very detailed. It would be nice to know how 
% a user wouldinteract with the system. What kind of “functionality” will the 
% remote interface contain?

\subsection{REST API}
The REST API functions primarily as a gateway in this design. For the
front-end to receive data via fetch calls in JavaScript, it needs to communicate 
with something that uses HTTP and preferably delivers data in JSON.

\section{Objectives}
The group wants to create a dashboard solution, that gets the necessary
information from the brewery machine to display information about the current
- and previous batches.

The group wants to host the REST API and Website on a Linux based server on a
fully qualified domain name using the container technology Docker which should
be configured via Docker Compose. Furthermore, the group aims to set up a
continuous integration pipeline for development via GitHub Actions (makes it
easy to automate software workflows) and continuous delivery via Watchtower (an
automatic deployment tool).

\section{Methods}
To keep track of the group work, the Scrum framework, with a few buts, is used.
Scrum consists of multiple artefacts and ceremonies, and in this project product
roadmap, Scrum meetings, product and sprint backlogs and burndown charts will
be used. Each sprint will have a duration of two weeks and the issues for the
sprint backlog will be chosen at the beginning of each sprint, at the Scrum
meeting. The Scrum meeting will take place each Friday and will be a mixture of
sprint planning, daily Scrum, and sprint review. To manage Scrum, ZenHub, a
management solution that can be integrated with GitHub, is used. On ZenHub the
group will create the roadmap, that acts as a schedule for the project and
board, which is where the issues will be handled. A burndown chart for each
sprint is automatically generated and kept up to date by ZenHub. The board will
consist of five columns, as seen below.

\subsection{Summary of requirements}
The group's proposed solution will adhere to the requirements given by the brewery Refslevbæk Bryghus A/S.

The manufacturing execution system, MES, must be able to control the brewery’s production.
It must be able to start and stop the production line,
as well as monitor the production and collect data from the production line.
The data must be stored for further analysis.
The MES must be able to keep track of the batches that the new machine is producing,
as well as collect various data from the machine that is associated with the current batch number.
After a finished batch production, the MES must be able to produce a batch report.
The report must contain the following.

\begin{itemize}
    \item This Batch ID
    \item Product type
    \item Amount of products (total, defect and acceptable)
    \item Amount of time used in the different states
    \item Logging of temperature over the production time
    \item Logging of humidity over the production time
\end{itemize}

The MES/SCADA (Supervisory control and data acquisition) system must be able to monitor the production and display live relevant data from the machine.
The documentation of the system must contain an illustration that defines the different components in the setup, in relation to the ISA88\^{}1213 Part 1 Physical Hierarchy model.
The system must have a visualisation that can be accessed and used to display production data.
The system must be able to collect the necessary data from the machine and calculate the overall equipment effectiveness, OEE\^{}131516, of the machine. The OEE must be available to be displayed by the system.
The system must be able to estimate the error function associated with the different products.
The system must be able to find the optimal production speed for each product type, based on an error simulation and the appertaining graph upon which the error simulation is built.

\subsection{List of requirements}
Below is a list of the above requirements. These requirements have been
prioritised using the MoSCoW method, where M is for Must have, S is for
Should have, C is for could have, and W is for Won't have.

\subsection{Use Case Diagram}
As seen below, the user (primary actor) of the system can interact with the MES.
The green ellipses represent the different use cases in the system, e.g.
Start/Stop production line, which enables the user to start or stop the
production. \\

On the left side of the diagram, the SCADA actor is shown, which is a secondary
actor in Bierproductie. The SCADA actor is responsible for making the beer
production machines endpoints available for the MES.

\subsection{Supplementary Requirements}
FURPS is a model for classifying functional and non-functional requirements. The
acronym stands for functionality, usability, reliability, performance, and
supportability. The group have used FURPS to classify the following: 

\begin{table}[ht]
    \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|>{\RaggedRight}p{4cm}|>{\RaggedRight}X|}
        \hline
        \textbf{FURPS}  & \textbf{Demands} \\

        Functionality  	&  \\
        \hline
        Usability      	& Documentation on usage of the REST API \\
        \hline
        Reliability    	& On server reboot, the application will automatically restart \\
        \hline
        Performance    	& Max response time (API: 400 ms) \\
        \hline
        Supportability 	& Minimum browser versions \\
        \hline
    \end{tabularx}
    \caption{Supplementary Requirements} 
    \label{table:Sup_requirements}
\end{table} 

\section{Stakeholders}
For this project, there is no stakeholder, as the group does not have the
opportunity to communicate with Reflevsbæk. This is a problem when developing
using Scrum, since this role is usually filled by a Product owner (abbreviated
to PO from here on out). Instead, the group has elected Kristian Nymann 
Jakobsen as an internal PO. The PO should under normal circumstances be one
from the customers firm, and their job is to choose which features (user
stories) that they would like developed next.

\section{Project Organisation}
In this project, work is distributed from planning meetings. These planning
meetings take place at the beginning of each sprint, where the workload is
estimated and distributed across the team members. Kristian Nymann Jakobsen was
chosen to be the Product Owner, so he oversees the “what”, with a focus on
value, time to market etc. Kenneth Munk Christiansen was chosen to be the Scrum
Master, so he ensures that the Scrum framework is understood and is used 
correctly throughout the project. Like the rest of the group, they are also a 
part of the Development Team. For easy version control and collaboration,
GitHub will be used. GitHub is a hosting service with a centralised repository,
built around git, a version control system that allows each team member to
download the code, modify it and upload the new version. For each issue is
created, a corresponding branch will automatically be made. When development
is deemed finished, the developer opens a merge request, where the code in
questions will be subject to review. The goal of this process is to improve
the quality and readability of the source code.

\section{Project Plan}
To ensure that it is feasible to complete the project within the designated
time frame, a project plan has been made with inspiration from the
\href{https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mZXxgDiwWwWpSyaQmMcafTjvXa2lQriszwTyt-Pf5BA/edit#gid=0}{project plan} supplied by the supervisor.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering 
\includegraphics[scale=0.24]{images/roadmap.png}
\label{figure:Project_plan}
\caption{project plan} 
\end{figure}

In this, it is shown when the different milestones must be completed to succeed
with the project. As mentioned above, sprints with a duration of two weeks will
be used throughout this project. Each sprint consists of issues from the product
backlog and is chosen at the beginning of each sprint, as described in section
Methods. To keep track of these sprints, a burndown chart will be made. This 
ensures the group that each sprint is completed, and if not, it is easy to see
where it went wrong, and the remaining issues can be transferred to
the next sprint.

\section{Risk}
The group foresees three risks with varying impact levels.

\begin{table}[ht]
    \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|>{\RaggedRight}p{1.7cm}|>{\RaggedRight}p{2.2cm}|>{\RaggedRight}p{1.4cm}|>{\RaggedRight}X|>{\RaggedRight}p{1.6cm}|}
        \hline
        \textbf{Risks} & \textbf{Assessment} & \textbf{Impact} & \textbf{Handling} & \textbf{Critical} \\
        \hline
        Covid-19 & High & High & 
        With regulations concerning social distancing and the risk of being infected
        with Covid-19, most work will take place from home. To avoid complications,
        expectations to finish delegated work to each group member will be raised. Each
        member is also expected to follow the lectures. The supervisor will be available
        for contact via e-mail, if questions should arise.
                 & Yes \\
                 \hline
        Schedule & High & High &
        If the group falls behind schedule, the delegated work tasks will be evaluated.
                 & Yes \\
                 \hline
        Lost team member        & Medium & Low & 
        Since the group has already lost a member, the group is currently undermanned.
        To stay on top of the semester project, expectations to finish delegated work to
        each member will be raised.
                                & Yes \\
                                \hline
