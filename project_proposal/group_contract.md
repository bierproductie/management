## Expectations and goals
- Each group member has a workload of 10 hours, as well as 2 hours for meetings.
- The outcome of the project must comply with the minimum requirements. Further
work will be prioritised according to the MoSCoW model (must, should, could and
won't have), since the workload is expected to be maintained.


## Work times
- Meeting times follow the quarter system (15 minutes between defined time to actual start time)
- The group will meet online every Friday at 8:00
- If a member of the group is sick or is otherwise unable to attend and is unable to
contact the remaining group members, the member must contact and inform the rest of the group
as soon as possible.
- For planned SCRUM meetings, an estimated workload of 10 hours/week will be distributed
to each group member, and it is each members own responsibility to comply with the due date.
- If the above-mentioned work is to be done in groups, work times are agreed upon in the group.
